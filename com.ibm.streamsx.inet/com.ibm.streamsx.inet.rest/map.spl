/**
 * [HTTPTupleView] provides default mapping visualization of
 * tuple data that contains latitude and longitude.
 * Each tuple in the window represents an object to be mapped
 * and must include these attributes (as SPL or JSON attributes):
 * * `id` - A unique identifier for the object being mapped.
 * * `float64 longitude` - Longitude of the object's location.
 * * `float64 latitude` - Latitude of the object's location.
 *
 * These attributes are optional:
 * * `markerType` - Marker used at the item's position on the map. Can be of type [MarkerType] or an `rstring` containing the enumeration's values (e.g. `GREEN`). If this attribute is not present in the tuple then `BLUE` is used.
 * * `note` - HTML for the popup that appears when the item's position marker is clicked. If this attribute is not present then the popup contains a string representation of the tuple.
 *
 * Access to the map is provided by the auto visualization table
 * located at the URL `streamsx.inet.resources/dojo/viewall.html`.
 * Locate the link in the table corresponding to the input port
 * containing the mappable data.
 *
 * Mapping is provided using `http://www.openlayers.org/api/OpenLayers.js` thus 
 * internet connectivity is required to use the default mapping.
